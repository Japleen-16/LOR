# LOR
## LOR and Crowdfunding Certificates<br />
Helping poor children or needy people in their times of need is one of the prime tasks every citizen should do, some think it as they offering help to someone while others think it's their duty. I am also very thankful to **MUSKURAHAT FOUNDATION** (a Non-Governmental Organisation) for providing me with the opportunity to help the needy children in their education. I worked as a crowdfunding internee for a month at this NGO and I was able to raise a pretty good amount  of donations in this time interval. And hence I am proud to announce that the **President of Muskurahat** also provided me with a Linkedin Recommendation as well as a Letter of Recommendation too for my performance.
